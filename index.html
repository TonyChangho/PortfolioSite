                                <p>Tony was my go-to guy when I needed frontend code that is 100% true to design, optimized, and on time.</p>

                                <p>He worked beautifully with the backend team from day one, kept the channels open with management, and was always first to offer help.</p>

                                <p>Many times I've seen Tony tread where no frontend coder had gone before, and emerge victorious on the other side. But never once did he lose his friendly, lighthearted, and collaborative spirit that everyone working with him finds so valuable.</p>

                                <p>Tony is a great guy and a no-nonsense front end developer. Pairing with him on any project was a pleasure, and more often than not, I'd learn something more about front end technologies as a result of our working together. Tony is friendly, communicative, has a great sense of humor, and most importantly really knows his technical stuff. He never shies away from a challenge, and always gets requirements completed quickly and working properly.</p>

                            <blockquote>
                                <p>Tony was one of the best hires we ever made. We thought we were getting a Jr. Front-end Developer. What we ended up with was a much more senior engineer who could make the web dance.</p>

                                <p>Not only is Tony a great engineer, he is also a great teammate. He is extremely accountable and a great presence on any software team. Most importantly, he cares about what he builds, and it shows. I would recommend him without reservation.</p>
